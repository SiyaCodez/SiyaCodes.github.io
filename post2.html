          <h3>Negative/Dark of Tech Trends</h3>
          <p>
            According to GeeksforGeeks (2024), usage of technology has increased significantly. It has impacted our lives by modifying how we learn, think, and communicate. Nowadays, it is hard to live without technology; it has become part of our lives. However, there is a wrong or dark side to the use of technology; see below how negatively technology is used:
           <br></br>
           <b> 1.	Artificial Intelligence </b> <br>
As Cheng et al. (2022) mentioned, AI has undoubtedly changed our lives and still has negative consequences. AI risks the information and privacy of a person, business, and society. Nowadays, when consumers buy a good or even search and suddenly the user dont buy anything, they will experience product recommendations in electronic markets. Cheng et al. (2022) stated that deep customer information is gained by AI, which leads to worse privacy concerns. 
On the societal side, big companies have laid off their workers as AI is taking over, which increases unemployment and affects the economy. Clarck (2023) stated that AI is responsible for spreading job displacement. “Positions that involve data entry, customer service, and basic analysis are particularly vulnerable. Chatbots and virtual assistants, for example, can handle customer inquiries and support, reducing the need for human involvement” (Clarck, 2023). The laying increases income security challenges for society.
Marchetti (2019) mentioned that resulting from job losses brought about by AI automation Have propelled South Africa's largest bank with a possibility to strike in the country's history. "In South Africa alone, almost 500,000 jobs are created through mining, an industry highly prone to automation. Similarly, back office, skilled administrative workers may also be at risk through the increasing adoption of robotic process automation and AI." (Marchetti, 2019). Adopting automation will increase SA’s unemployment rate, which is already high.
           <br></br>

<b>2.	Cybersecurity </b> <br>
As we all connect, use technology, and become connected, there are dark incidences where technology is negatively used. “Between November 2022 and October 2023, over 30 thousand cybercrime incidents were detected worldwide. Of this total, over 900 cases involved small companies. The organizations in the public administration sector were the most affected among the industries researched, with 12,217 reported cybercrime cases” (Statista, 2024). This tells us that even though technology is changing our lives, it is also putting us in many problems, especially financially, as hackers are steadily finding loopholes. 
These criminals target weak systems, networks, infrastructure, government, businesses, and people impacted on a social and economic level. Interpol (n,d) mentioned that cyber threats include phishing, ransomware, and breaches, but other new forms are being discovered. These hackers are very agile and well-coordinated; while we are happy with the discovery of technology, that is where they discover new strategies for their attacks.
Buchan and Devanny (2024) stated that, like in other countries, South Africa's digital access has significantly increased, and there is an increase in the attack surface available to hackers. The COVID-19 outbreak has caused an enormous increase in cybercrime in the country; these hackers use ransomware via email. “South Africa reportedly suffers the most ransomware and business email compromise incidents in Africa” (Buchan and Devanny). 
           <br></br>

<b>3.	Blockchain </b> <br>
Bitcoin drew attention worldwide during COVID-19, causing investors to invest in others, such as NFT. However, hackers find a loophole as it is hard to track them down. Yaghi (2023) stated that the blockchain's borderless nature of transactions allows criminals to transfer money quickly and easily without depending on banks. Hackers use blockchain technology for money laundering, making it hard to trace how it was laundered. “Blockchain technology has been used to create and promote cryptocurrency scams, such as Ponzi schemes and pump-and-dump schemes” (Yaghi, 2023).
Johann Steynberg, CEO of Mirror Trading International, went missing in South Africa, leaving thousands of investors without money, as My BroadBand stated (2021). Experts warned investors that MIT was a Ponzi scheme, that the companies' members were nowhere to be seen, and that the investors did not get their returns. The Hawks launched a serious investigation, and according to the news, there has not been much solution. This clarifies that technology can be used to harm people; even financially, l laws and regulations need to take place.
